            <h2>Simple Moving Average (SMA)</h2>
            <img src="{{ url_for('static', filename='images/sma.png') }}" alt="Simple Moving Average">
            <p>A Simple Moving Average (SMA) is an arithmetic moving average calculated by adding recent prices and then dividing that figure by the number of time periods in the calculation average. It's a technical indicator that shows the average price of a security over a specific period. SMAs are used to smooth out price data to identify the direction of the trend.</p>

            <h2>Exponential Moving Average (EMA)</h2>
            <img src="{{ url_for('static', filename='images/ema.png') }}" alt="Exponential Moving Average">
            <p>An Exponential Moving Average (EMA) is a type of moving average that places a greater weight and significance on the most recent data points. The EMA is more responsive to recent price changes than the SMA, which makes it a popular choice for short-term traders.</p>

            <h2>Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD)</h2>
            <img src="{{ url_for('static', filename='images/macd.png') }}" alt="Moving Average Convergence Divergence">
            <p>The Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD) is a trend-following momentum indicator that shows the relationship between two moving averages of a security's price. The MACD is calculated by subtracting the 26-period EMA from the 12-period EMA. A nine-day EMA of the MACD, called the "signal line," is then plotted on top of the MACD line, which can function as a trigger for buy and sell signals.</p>

            <h2>Relative Strength Index (RSI)</h2>
            <img src="{{ url_for('static', filename='images/rsi.png') }}" alt="Relative Strength Index">
            <p>The Relative Strength Index (RSI) is a momentum oscillator that measures the speed and change of price movements. The RSI oscillates between zero and 100. Traditionally, the RSI is considered overbought when above 70 and oversold when below 30. It can be used to identify general trends and potential reversal points.</p>

            <h2>Bollinger Bands (BBANDS)</h2>
            <img src="{{ url_for('static', filename='images/bbands.png') }}" alt="Bollinger Bands">
            <p>Bollinger Bands are a type of statistical chart characterizing the prices and volatility over time of a financial instrument or commodity. They consist of a middle band being an N-period simple moving average (SMA), an upper band at K times an N-period standard deviation above the middle band, and a lower band at K times an N-period standard deviation below the middle band. They are used to identify overbought or oversold conditions.</p>
